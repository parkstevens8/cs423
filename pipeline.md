# Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document details the design decisions and steps involved in creating the data preprocessing and transformation pipeline for the dataset used in this project. The goal of this pipeline is to prepare raw input data for machine learning models by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

## Pipeline Steps

The pipeline consists of the following main steps:

1.  **Handling Missing Values:**
    *   **Numerical Features:** Missing values in numerical columns are imputed using a `SimpleImputer` with a `mean` strategy. This replaces missing values with the mean of the non-missing values in that column.
    *   **Categorical Features:** Missing values in categorical columns are imputed using a `SimpleImputer` with a `constant` strategy, replacing missing values with a placeholder string like 'unknown'.

2.  **Encoding Categorical Features:**
    *   Categorical features are encoded using `OneHotEncoder` to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. The `handle_unknown='ignore'` option is used to handle any unseen categories during transformation, preventing errors.

3.  **Scaling Numerical Features:**
    *   Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler`. This standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This is important for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features (e.g., KNN, Logistic Regression, ANN).

## Design Decisions

*   **Choice of Imputation Strategy:** The mean imputation for numerical features was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness when the distribution of the data is roughly symmetrical. For categorical features, using a constant value like 'unknown' explicitly marks missing data as its own category, which can be informative for the model.
*   **One-Hot Encoding:** One-Hot Encoding was selected for categorical features to avoid introducing ordinal relationships where none exist. This approach creates binary columns for each category, ensuring that the model treats each category independently.
*   **Standard Scaling:** Standard Scaling was preferred for numerical features as it is robust to outliers compared to min-max scaling and is a common and effective method for preparing data for a wide range of models.
*   **Pipeline Structure:** Using a `ColumnTransformer` within a `Pipeline` allows for applying different preprocessing steps to different subsets of columns (numerical vs. categorical) in a streamlined and organized manner. This prevents data leakage by ensuring that transformations are fitted only on the training data and then applied consistently to new data.

## Code Implementation

The pipeline is implemented using `scikit-learn` and includes `SimpleImputer`, `OneHotEncoder`, `StandardScaler`, `ColumnTransformer`, and `Pipeline`. The code defines separate transformers for numerical and categorical features which are then combined using `ColumnTransformer`. This combined transformer is then integrated into a `Pipeline` along with any other steps (though in this case, the ColumnTransformer is the main transformation step).

## Future Improvements

*   Explore more sophisticated imputation methods like K-Nearest Neighbors imputation or model-based imputation.
*   Investigate alternative encoding techniques for categorical features, such as target encoding or feature hashing, depending on the dataset characteristics and model requirements.
*   Consider using robust scaling methods if the numerical features contain significant outliers.
*   Implement feature selection techniques to potentially reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.
